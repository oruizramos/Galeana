*HTML/CSS(SASS) ONLY Narrative Game*

A little experiment since I wanted to create a narrative experience while limiting myself to not even using vanilla Javascript. 


*Narrative*

The game invites to reflect upon the tragic historical events of October 2, 1968 in Mexico City, known as the "Tlatelolco Massacre", the culmination of a series of protests which began as Mexico City was preparing to host the Olympics that month — an event intended to showcase a modern nation with a growing middle class at the forefront of emerging economies-

By taking to the streets just months before the inauguration of the games, students cracked that veneer, revealing a generation’s latent anger against the country’s repressive rule as the world looked on.

The government crushed the movement in a spasm of violence beyond anyone’s worst fears. On Oct. 2, students who had gathered in a plaza for an evening meeting were picked off by government snipers perched on rooftops. Chaos broke out. The soldiers at the edge of the plaza, whose mission was to disperse the crowd, instead began to shoot into it.

When the carnage ended, dozens lay dead and hundreds were shoved into vans, many of them to be tried and imprisoned. Twelve days later, President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz opened the Olympic Games.

*Game Design/Mechanics*

In order to allude to the historic memory, the game revolves around making the player remember the correct steps in order to go from the level's start to the goal.  

The -sort of- cryptic testimonies and opinions showcased in each level serve also as hints for the player to be able to complete them.
